# Microverse Capstone Project Description

 This project is the Final capstone project of my first module at microverse. It is aim at building responsive UI of an online website for  Music Entertainment Industry , so in this project I built the home and the about page of the conference page (and readable) on all screens.
The template I used to create this template was originally designed by [Cindy Shin in Behance.](https://www.behance.net/adagio07)
